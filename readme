Set of apis that provide a framework for general automation with ComputerCraft 
computers and turtles, as well as implementations of certain facilities based
on this framework.

Facility
A "unit" of automation, generally a single structure, which 
provides some set of services to players, turtles, other facilities. Each 
facility is managed by a central computer called a manager, and has one or 
more turtles to carry out relevant tasks for the facility. Some facilities
central structure will be no more than a site containing the facility manager
computer, while providing services over a distributed area around that 
facility. For such distributed service facilities, the central structure may 
even be shared with other service managers.

Manager
The central computer of each facility. Tracks the status of the facility and
directs the actions of all turtle drones assigned to it. In addition to 
directing turtles, managers take requests from players and other facilities
which will affect the priorities and operation of the facility. Managers will
provide an interface, accessible directly through the manager itself, or 
remotely via rednet from any computer with the appropriate remote 
administration software.

Drone
A drone is a turtle running a core program intended to allow it to be directed
and monitored by facility managers.

Access Terminal
Access terminals simply provide an interface to communicate remotely with 
managers to view the status of facilities and their drones, to manage the
facility's settings, and to perform other administrative tasks.
